1.  Responsive design

    Utilizing Bootstrap and custom CSS, all components are designed to maintain consistency across various screen sizes. This ensures a seamless user interface that adapts responsively to any device.

2.  React Rendering and React Router Dom

    Employing React rendering promotes a modular and reusable codebase. The integration of React Router Dom enables seamless navigation between different sections of the website without requiring page reloads, enhancing the overall user experience.

3.  Vite as a build tool

    Vite serves as an efficient build tool, accelerating development through bundling and a rapid development server. This tool enhances the speed of the development workflow, contributing to a more streamlined and productive coding experience.
